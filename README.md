# neural-net

## “What I cannot create, I do not understand” - Richard Feynman

#### neural-net.py is my implementation of a simple neural network in Python using NumPy. For now, it uses a custom spiral dataset with three classes and trains the network using stochastic gradient descent. The current code has only a single hidden layer with 64 neurons.

#### Here is the dataset visualized with matplotlib:
