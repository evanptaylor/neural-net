# neural-net

### “What I cannot create, I do not understand” - Richard Feynman

neural-net.py is my implementation of a simple neural network in Python using NumPy. For now, it uses a custom dataset with three classes and trains the network using stochastic gradient descent. The current code uses only a single hidden layer with 64 neurons.

This specific 'sprial' dataset is from nnfs.io--a good resource to learn more about neural networks

#### Here is the dataset visualized with matplotlib:

#### Here's an example output after 10,000 epochs:
